Best parts:
- "My state of mind and how I am in my practice ultimately is going to be embodied in the work. If I'm consumed with anxiety that's how the work will end up. I I think to be hopeful and optimistic and joyful in our practice and be that way in how we relate to each other and our colleagues. I actually think that's how the products will end up."
- "Many people mistakingly think that simplicity is about removing clutter and to me that means you just would end up with an uncluttered product. I think that's what a lot of minimalism ends up. My goal and our goal collectively has been to bring order to chaos. Simplicity to me is trying to succinctly express the essence of something and its purpose and its role"
- "If it doesn't work, it's ugly"
- "We have this ability to sense care. And we sense carelessness"
- "Beauty takes time"
