## Road and Traffic Conditions

## Experience on the Samruddhi Expressway 

- **Speed & Comfort:** Maintained a steady 100 km/h. The max allowed speed is 120 km/h.  
- **Duration:** The stretch from Sambhaji Nagar (Aurangabad) to Nagpur took 5-5.5 hours, including breaks.  
- **Toll Charges:** ₹730 for the entire stretch.  
- **Facilities:** Limited food options—mostly small stalls at petrol pumps. If you are planning a trip, carry food or eat before hitting the expressway.  
- **Fuel:** Petrol is ₹1 more expensive on the expressway, with pumps spaced 60-70 km apart.  
- **Caution:** It can feel really quiet with stretches where you see no other vehicles. It feels boring and sleepy, so take breaks to stay alert.

## Citroën C3 Performance: A Reliable Road Trip Buddy  

We couldn’t be happier with the Citroën C3’s performance:  
- **Fuel Efficiency:** The odometer showed an impressive 20.7 km/l. Factoring in expenses, we estimate a real-world mileage of around 19 km/l.  
- **Comfort:** Even after long hours on the road, we didn’t feel overly tired.  
- **Storage:** The car handled a significant amount of luggage, with room for extra luggage on the return journey without removing the parcel tray.  
- **AC Performance:** The air conditioning was top-notch. Even with AC usage for 80% of the trip, we never needed to turn the fan above level 1!
