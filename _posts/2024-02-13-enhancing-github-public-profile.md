GitHub profiles are increasingly becoming important in the tech consulting and hiring world. One of the most significant benefits of having a GitHub profile is the ability to showcase your work. By creating a profile and sharing your repositories, you can demonstrate your coding skills and highlight the projects youâ€™ve worked on. This can be particularly valuable when looking for new job opportunities or when trying to build a personal brand in the tech industry.

Many employers and recruiters use GitHub to search for potential job candidates. By having a well-maintained profile with high-quality code and contributions to open source projects, you can make yourself more visible to potential employers and increase your chances of finding job opportunities.

I recently discovered that you can enhance your GitHub public profile by creating a special repository with README.md file. Here is how my public profile looks now.

To enhance your GitHub public profile follow these steps:

1. Create a public repo with the name same as your GitHub username. Since my username is priyankt, my repo name is priyankt. View my repo for reference.
2. Initialize the repo with a README.md file.
3. Browse all the different types of profiles available on (awesome github profile)[https://zzetao.github.io/awesome-github-profile/] website. This will give you an idea of what you can include in your profile. Pick the ones that you like.
4. Build your profile using markdown content.

I also maintain a blog on my website priyankt.com and decided to include my recent blog posts in the profile section. The recent blog posts should automatically update after I have added a blog on my website. We can achieve this, using GitHub actions. You should be familiar with how to use different actions from GitHub marketplace. Refer the .github/workflows/main.yaml and feed.py files in the repo to get an idea of how everything is organised.
