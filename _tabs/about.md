Technopreneur, philosopher, and aspiring first-principle thinker with a wealth of experience in business and technology consulting. Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in building software solutions for startups and the capital markets. I find immense satisfaction in venturing into uncharted territories, where the possibilities are endless, and the potential for impact is substantial.

I was previously the co-founder of the software services company [CodeToArt](https://codetoart.com/) where we built software solutions for startups at unprecedented pace. At CodeToArt, I was responsible for the training, development and delivery of the backend and the iOS projects. This experience has given me valuable insights into the intricacies of entrepreneurship. I successfully exited from the company in 2019.

Since COVID, I have also grown interest in finance and trading in the capital markets. I sell options on the side to generate passive income. The simple expiry strategy that I use have given me an 18% return on the deployed capital with very low drawdown. During the course, I have also grown interest in personal finance and money markets.

I strongly believe in the power of philosophical thinking to drive innovation and create lasting solutions. By combining my philosophical outlook with my technical expertise, I bring a unique approach to problem-solving.

I am also looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organisations that share the same passion for pushing boundaries and making a positive impact.

Let's connect on LinkedIn, where we can explore the possibilities of working together on ventures that have the potential to shape a better future.
