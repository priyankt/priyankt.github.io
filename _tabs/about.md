Technopreneur, philosopher, and aspiring first-principle thinker with a wealth of experience in business and technology consulting. Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in building software solutions for startups and the capital markets. I find immense satisfaction in venturing into uncharted territories, where the possibilities are endless, and the potential for transformative impact is substantial.

Among my significant achievements, I take pride in co-founding, scaling, and successfully exiting from a software services company. This experience has given me invaluable insights into the intricacies of entrepreneurship and has fortified my commitment to excellence and delivering exceptional results.

An area of expertise that sets me apart is my adeptness in utilising the options market to generate passive income. With a remarkable 20% return on deployed capital and an impressively low 0.125% drawdown, I have honed my skills in making informed financial decisions and maximising returns.

Beyond my professional accomplishments, I strongly believe in the power of philosophical thinking to drive innovation and create lasting solutions. By combining my philosophical outlook with my technical prowess, I bring a unique and holistic approach to problem-solving.

I am also looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organisations that share the same passion for pushing boundaries and making a positive impact.

Let's connect on LinkedIn, where we can explore the possibilities of working together on ventures that have the potential to shape a better future.
